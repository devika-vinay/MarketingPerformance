# üìä Marketing Performance Analytics

This project analyzed a large-scale **marketing dataset** to evaluate ad performance across devices, networks, and business KPIs. The work combined **trend analysis, segmentation, and KPI evaluation** to generate insights and recommendations for optimizing campaign strategy.  

---

## üîç Objectives  

1. Identify performance trends for **clicks and impressions over time**.  
2. Compare **device type performance** (mobile, desktop, specialty devices).  
3. Evaluate **network-level efficiency** using CTR (Click-Through Rate) and CPM (Cost Per Mille).  
4. Recommend strategies for **budget allocation** and campaign optimization.

## üìä Key Insights  

### Device Type Analysis  
- **High Spend on Mobile Platforms**: Mobile-web and mobile-app recorded the **highest average spend**, indicating advertisers prioritize mobile audiences.  
- **Desktop Remains Strong**: Desktop followed closely behind, still drawing major investment and output.  
- **Specialty Devices Underperform**: Connected-TV, set-top boxes, and tablets had low spend and low measurable output.  

### Performance Trends  
- Broadly, **higher spend correlated with higher impressions**, confirming investment scale drives measurable output.  
- However, ensuring **ROI efficiency** (cost per result) requires deeper checks beyond impressions.  

### Network-Level Analysis  
- **CTR Variation**: Networks like **ID 91** showed high CTR, indicating strong relevance or effective targeting.  
- **CPM Variation**: Networks 284, 288, 289, and 294 had high CPM, suggesting cost inefficiency or competition.  
- **Low-Cost Efficient Networks**: Networks 85, 95, 94, and 20 demonstrated lower CPMs, making them attractive if CTR remains acceptable.  
- A high CTR does not guarantee ROI if CPM is also high. Conversely, modest CTR with low CPM can be cost-effective if conversions are strong.

## üí° Recommendations  

- **Rebalance Spend**:  
  - Maintain strong investment in **mobile-web, desktop, and mobile-app**, but refine targeting/creatives to ensure ROI.  
  - Reassess low-return specialty devices; allocate cautiously until they prove strategic value.  

- **Network Optimization**:  
  - **Scale cost-efficient networks** (low CPM, good CTR) for improved ROI.  
  - Closely monitor high-cost networks (284, 288, 289, 294) to ensure spend is justified.  

- **Cross-Device Consistency**:  
  - Ensure ad messaging and UX remain consistent across mobile and desktop, given multi-device user journeys.  

- **Ongoing Monitoring**:  
  - Regularly reevaluate spend-to-output efficiency as market conditions, consumer behavior, and platform features evolve.
